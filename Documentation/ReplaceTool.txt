Background: 
It is needed a tool that will replace a field with the value that the customer wants for all selected records.

Requirements:
- Create a new generic page that accepts any kind of table
- Customer must select the field that wants to modify
- Customer must write as text the new value.
- System should evaluate the new value with the type of selected field (f.e. do not allow text in an Integer field)
- Via code, the developer can force the fields to be seen in the new page
- Do not allow to change PK fields
- Do not show flowfields or flowfilters

UAC:
- Customer can select the field that wants to modify (expect flowfields and flowfilters)
- Customer can write as text the new value (evaluate the value with the type of field)
- Is it possible to force the fields to be seen in the new page
- PK fields cannot be changed

Usage Instructions:
- Add a dependency in the app to be modified with BCTools app
- Add a page extension that will call page "Replace Dialog"

    action(Replace)
        {
            Caption = 'Replace';

            trigger OnAction();
            var
                ReplacePage: Page "Replace Dialog";
            begin
                ReplacePage.SetNewRecord(Rec, '<Filtered of field nos. to be shown or empty>');
                ReplacePage.RunModal();
            end;
        }

- Select field to be replaced
- Write new value as text. Important: decimal values should be written with the localization of the client
- Click OK to proceed
- Click OK to the confirmation message shown. Here will be written the no. of records that will be changed.
